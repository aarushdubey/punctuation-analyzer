### üìñ About
**Punctuation as Grammatology** has emerged out of curiosity about a writer's usage of punctuation in fiction.

As general discourse has it, punctuation is either disappearing or shrinking in the way written language works. For instance, the Internet is seen as a place where there is not much use for punctuation. The usage of punctuation has been shown to decrease in general. The usage of the full stop has increased in the last 200 years while the usage of the comma has decreased ‚Äî a finding that suggests that writing moves towards simpler, closure-seeking or closure-affirming discourse.

While these observations and findings about writing are true at a macro level as they speak to a huge corpus of texts, it is fascinating to engage with the micro or singular. After all, the general and the particular are forever engaged in a beautiful dance with each other.

Through this web application, the experiment on one author's punctuation is being made available for others to explore punctuation in texts they wish to understand better.

*Please note that the punctuation data generated by this application is not absolute and in itself does not mean anything. It is only meant to draw attention to punctuation as grammatology, a minor site within writing that is usually understood as logocentric, and focused on words.*
